        <p>As the Amhara people continue to suffer under the regime of Abiy Ahmed, lets take a look at the once praised leader turned brutal Dictator.</p>
      <p>As the Amhara people continue to suffer under the regime of Abiy Ahmed, let's take a look at the once-praised leader turned brutal dictator.</p>

<p>Abiy Ahmed first came to power in 2018, after the former coalition government, ruled by the TPLF, fell due to widespread protests among several Ethiopian regions, with the most notable being the Oromo and Amhara regions. The political upheaval was driven by years of dissatisfaction with the TPLF's dominance, as well as systemic ethnic marginalization and economic inequality that sparked widespread unrest.</p>

<p>Crucial to understand is that Ethiopia is a country with regions based on ethnicity. Experts call it an "Ethnic-based Federal country." Each region has its own governing structure, and the country's federal system is designed to give political power to Ethiopia's diverse ethnic groups. However, this system has also contributed to ethnic competition and political instability, as groups often clash over control of resources and power.</p>

<p>In the lead-up to Abiy Ahmed’s rise, the Oromo and Amhara regions worked together to push the TPLF out of power. The result was the appointment of Abiy, an Oromo, as the new Prime Minister of Ethiopia. This was seen by many as a new era for Ethiopia—one that could overcome the deep-rooted ethnic tensions and political conflicts that had plagued the country for decades.</p>

<h2>A HOPEFUL PROMISE</h2>

<p>Initially, Abiy's rule seemed promising. He ended long-standing religious and ethnic conflicts, brought together many of Ethiopia's ethnic groups under a common cause, and worked to ensure stability. His diplomatic efforts were particularly lauded when he ended the 20-year war between Ethiopia and Eritrea in 2018. The peace agreement with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki opened up borders, resumed diplomatic ties, and restored flights, which were once frozen due to the conflict. This historic peace agreement earned Abiy international praise, including the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize in 2019.</p>

<p>Abiy also embarked on a sweeping campaign of reforms. He released political prisoners, including opposition leaders and activists who had been detained by the previous regime. He worked to dismantle the country's ethnic-based political system, aiming to reduce ethnic divisions by introducing more inclusive policies. He also formed the "Prosperity Party," which replaced the old EPRDF coalition, and appointed women to high-level government positions. His government’s gender parity in leadership was hailed as one of the most progressive in Africa, with women making up over half of the cabinet members.</p>

<p>The reforms were seen as a bold step toward democratization, and for a time, Abiy was viewed as a beacon of hope for Ethiopia's future. His vision was of a unified Ethiopia that transcended ethnic divisions, and for this, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. However, as the political landscape shifted and tensions between the various ethnic groups resurfaced, Abiy’s leadership came under increasing scrutiny.</p>

<p>While Abiy's initial reforms were widely praised, his later actions raised concerns about his commitment to democracy and human rights. Tensions between the Ethiopian government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which had been part of the former ruling coalition, escalated dramatically. In late 2020, armed conflict broke out in Tigray after the Ethiopian government accused the TPLF of attacking federal military bases. The ensuing war has resulted in thousands of deaths, widespread displacement, and a humanitarian crisis that has deeply affected the Tigray region.</p>

<h2>TIGRAY, AMHARA, AND OROMIA</h2>

<p>The Tigray conflict, which is still ongoing, has been marked by severe atrocities committed by both sides, including reports of mass killings, sexual violence, and the use of starvation as a weapon of war. Abiy's government has been accused of war crimes, with the United Nations and human rights organizations calling for an independent investigation into the actions of the Ethiopian military and allied forces. The international community has pressured Abiy to cease hostilities and negotiate a peaceful resolution, but the conflict remains unresolved, and humanitarian aid access is limited.</p>

<p>The war in Tigray has exacerbated Ethiopia's already volatile ethnic relations. Violence has spread to other regions, including Oromia and the Amhara region, where ethnic clashes have claimed numerous lives. These clashes have further fueled the perception that Abiy's government, once seen as a unifier, is now stoking division and ethnic nationalism. The Prime Minister's efforts to centralize power have also alienated some ethnic groups, particularly in the Tigray region, which feels marginalized by the Prosperity Party.</p>

<p>Abiy’s handling of internal dissent has also shifted dramatically. What was once an open environment for political discussion and reform has become increasingly repressive. Journalists, activists, and opposition leaders have faced arrests, intimidation, and censorship. Media outlets critical of the government have been shut down, and reports of arbitrary detentions have become more frequent. The government has employed heavy-handed tactics to suppress protests and dissent, undermining the initial promises of democratic reform.</p>

<p>In the face of rising opposition and growing dissatisfaction, Abiy's government has increasingly relied on authoritarian methods to maintain control. His government's centralization of power and the suppression of opposition parties have led to accusations of dictatorship. Many Ethiopians, once hopeful for change, now view Abiy's leadership as a betrayal of the democratic principles he once championed.</p>

<p>The humanitarian situation in Ethiopia is dire. The war in Tigray has displaced over two million people, with many fleeing to neighboring countries like Sudan. The conflict has caused severe food shortages, with millions of people facing famine conditions. In addition to the war, the country is grappling with widespread poverty, underdevelopment, and a fragile healthcare system that is ill-equipped to handle the crisis. The political and humanitarian crises have placed enormous strain on the Ethiopian government, which is struggling to balance the demands of war and peace.</p>

<p>Abiy’s once-glowing international reputation has taken a serious hit. While he was once lauded as a champion of peace, his leadership is now under intense scrutiny. World leaders who once praised his reforms and his peace efforts are now calling for accountability, and there are growing calls for sanctions against his government in response to human rights violations. His Nobel Peace Prize is now viewed by many as premature, given the ongoing violence and the erosion of democratic principles in Ethiopia.</p>

<p>The question now is what the future holds for Ethiopia. Abiy’s government faces mounting pressure both domestically and internationally. The country remains deeply divided, with ethnic tensions simmering in many regions. The war in Tigray has created a profound sense of mistrust and fear, and the humanitarian crisis continues to worsen. It is unclear whether Abiy will be able to restore peace and unity or if Ethiopia will descend further into civil conflict. The international community has an important role to play in pushing for a peaceful resolution, but the path to reconciliation appears to be fraught with difficulty.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Abiy Ahmed's transformation from a celebrated reformer to a controversial figure highlights the complexities of leadership in a deeply divided nation. His initial promises of peace, reform, and unity have been overshadowed by the ongoing conflict, repression, and humanitarian crisis. The suffering of the Ethiopian people, particularly in the Amhara and Tigray regions, underscores the dire need for a new direction, one that puts the welfare of Ethiopia’s citizens above political survival and ethnic power struggles. Whether Ethiopia can find a way forward remains uncertain, but the current trajectory suggests that the road ahead will be long and difficult.</p>

        <i>What a second Trump Term Would look like. - </i>
<p><b>On November 6th,</b> the world woke up to the news that 74 million American voters had reelected Donald J. Trump as their next President. For the first time in 20 years, Trump won both the Popular Vote and the Electoral College vote, defeating incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<h2>Key Issues Under Trump's Second Term</h2>
<p>As President, Trump has outlined several key domestic and foreign policy priorities for his second term in office:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Domestic Plans:</b> Trump has promised to focus on cutting taxes, reducing regulations, and bolstering the economy through pro-business policies. His administration aims to strengthen manufacturing, increase energy independence, and improve the healthcare system by reducing government involvement and expanding private sector competition.</li>
    <li><b>Immigration:</b> A cornerstone of Trump's 2016 and 2020 campaigns, his second term is expected to see a continuation of hardline immigration policies. Trump has indicated plans to further tighten border security, expand the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and prioritize deportation of undocumented immigrants involved in criminal activities.</li>
    <li><b>NATO:</b> Trump has been a vocal critic of NATO during his first term, questioning the alliance’s value to the U.S. and calling for other member nations to increase their defense spending. In a second term, Trump is expected to push for greater burden-sharing among NATO members while maintaining the alliance's relevance in a changing geopolitical landscape.</li>
    <li><b>Russo-Ukrainian War:</b> Trump's approach to the ongoing war in Ukraine is likely to prioritize negotiation over continued U.S. military involvement. While Trump has criticized U.S. financial and military aid to Ukraine, his stance has evolved, with some reports suggesting that he may seek a ceasefire and peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, should he return to office.</li>
    <li><b>Gaza and Israel War:</b> Trump's foreign policy in the Middle East is expected to remain pro-Israel, reinforcing his previous stance during his first term. He has voiced strong support for Israeli security measures and criticized international efforts to challenge Israel's position on Palestinian territories. His administration may also seek a more aggressive stance against Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Road to a Stronger America: Trump's First Term and What’s Next</h2>

<img src="/images/trumprally.jpg" alt="Donald Trump at rally" style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius: 8px;">

<p>Donald Trump's first term was marked by bold policies that prioritized American interests above all else. From tax cuts that spurred economic growth to deregulation that fueled job creation, Trump’s presidency proved that a pro-business, America-first approach could deliver tangible results. Unemployment reached historic lows, wages rose, and the stock market surged—defining moments of his tenure that continue to shape the nation’s economic landscape.</p>

<p>In foreign policy, Trump’s "America First" doctrine brought a shift toward realism, questioning longstanding alliances and trade deals that he believed were unfair to the U.S. He renegotiated NAFTA, withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement, and challenged China on trade practices. His tough stance on international relations made clear that the U.S. would no longer be taken advantage of, earning him both admiration and criticism around the world. Yet, for many Americans, Trump's leadership restored a sense of national pride and strength on the global stage.</p>

<p>Looking ahead to his second term, Trump’s vision for America is clear: a nation where jobs are plentiful, the border is secure, and American power is respected. The speculation around what a second Trump administration could mean is largely shaped by the success of his first-term policies, but with a renewed focus on issues like energy independence, manufacturing revival, and military strength. His commitment to putting America first will likely guide his decisions, both domestically and internationally, ensuring that his policies are centered around the American people.</p>

<p>With the support of millions of voters and a record of success behind him, Trump’s re-election signifies a return to conservative values, economic prosperity, and a strong, independent America. As he moves forward, his leadership will continue to champion the ideals that made the U.S. great, ensuring a brighter future for generations to come.</p>
