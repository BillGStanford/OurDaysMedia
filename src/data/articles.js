        <p>As the Amhara people continue to suffer under the regime of Abiy Ahmed, lets take a look at the once praised leader turned brutal Dictator.</p>
      <p>As the Amhara people continue to suffer under the regime of Abiy Ahmed, let's take a look at the once-praised leader turned brutal dictator.</p>

<p>Abiy Ahmed first came to power in 2018, after the former coalition government, ruled by the TPLF, fell due to widespread protests among several Ethiopian regions, with the most notable being the Oromo and Amhara regions. The political upheaval was driven by years of dissatisfaction with the TPLF's dominance, as well as systemic ethnic marginalization and economic inequality that sparked widespread unrest.</p>

<p>Crucial to understand is that Ethiopia is a country with regions based on ethnicity. Experts call it an "Ethnic-based Federal country." Each region has its own governing structure, and the country's federal system is designed to give political power to Ethiopia's diverse ethnic groups. However, this system has also contributed to ethnic competition and political instability, as groups often clash over control of resources and power.</p>

<p>In the lead-up to Abiy Ahmed’s rise, the Oromo and Amhara regions worked together to push the TPLF out of power. The result was the appointment of Abiy, an Oromo, as the new Prime Minister of Ethiopia. This was seen by many as a new era for Ethiopia—one that could overcome the deep-rooted ethnic tensions and political conflicts that had plagued the country for decades.</p>

<h2>A HOPEFUL PROMISE</h2>

<p>Initially, Abiy's rule seemed promising. He ended long-standing religious and ethnic conflicts, brought together many of Ethiopia's ethnic groups under a common cause, and worked to ensure stability. His diplomatic efforts were particularly lauded when he ended the 20-year war between Ethiopia and Eritrea in 2018. The peace agreement with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki opened up borders, resumed diplomatic ties, and restored flights, which were once frozen due to the conflict. This historic peace agreement earned Abiy international praise, including the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize in 2019.</p>

<p>Abiy also embarked on a sweeping campaign of reforms. He released political prisoners, including opposition leaders and activists who had been detained by the previous regime. He worked to dismantle the country's ethnic-based political system, aiming to reduce ethnic divisions by introducing more inclusive policies. He also formed the "Prosperity Party," which replaced the old EPRDF coalition, and appointed women to high-level government positions. His government’s gender parity in leadership was hailed as one of the most progressive in Africa, with women making up over half of the cabinet members.</p>

<p>The reforms were seen as a bold step toward democratization, and for a time, Abiy was viewed as a beacon of hope for Ethiopia's future. His vision was of a unified Ethiopia that transcended ethnic divisions, and for this, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. However, as the political landscape shifted and tensions between the various ethnic groups resurfaced, Abiy’s leadership came under increasing scrutiny.</p>

<p>While Abiy's initial reforms were widely praised, his later actions raised concerns about his commitment to democracy and human rights. Tensions between the Ethiopian government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which had been part of the former ruling coalition, escalated dramatically. In late 2020, armed conflict broke out in Tigray after the Ethiopian government accused the TPLF of attacking federal military bases. The ensuing war has resulted in thousands of deaths, widespread displacement, and a humanitarian crisis that has deeply affected the Tigray region.</p>

<h2>TIGRAY, AMHARA, AND OROMIA</h2>

<p>The Tigray conflict, which is still ongoing, has been marked by severe atrocities committed by both sides, including reports of mass killings, sexual violence, and the use of starvation as a weapon of war. Abiy's government has been accused of war crimes, with the United Nations and human rights organizations calling for an independent investigation into the actions of the Ethiopian military and allied forces. The international community has pressured Abiy to cease hostilities and negotiate a peaceful resolution, but the conflict remains unresolved, and humanitarian aid access is limited.</p>

<p>The war in Tigray has exacerbated Ethiopia's already volatile ethnic relations. Violence has spread to other regions, including Oromia and the Amhara region, where ethnic clashes have claimed numerous lives. These clashes have further fueled the perception that Abiy's government, once seen as a unifier, is now stoking division and ethnic nationalism. The Prime Minister's efforts to centralize power have also alienated some ethnic groups, particularly in the Tigray region, which feels marginalized by the Prosperity Party.</p>

<p>Abiy’s handling of internal dissent has also shifted dramatically. What was once an open environment for political discussion and reform has become increasingly repressive. Journalists, activists, and opposition leaders have faced arrests, intimidation, and censorship. Media outlets critical of the government have been shut down, and reports of arbitrary detentions have become more frequent. The government has employed heavy-handed tactics to suppress protests and dissent, undermining the initial promises of democratic reform.</p>

<p>In the face of rising opposition and growing dissatisfaction, Abiy's government has increasingly relied on authoritarian methods to maintain control. His government's centralization of power and the suppression of opposition parties have led to accusations of dictatorship. Many Ethiopians, once hopeful for change, now view Abiy's leadership as a betrayal of the democratic principles he once championed.</p>

<p>The humanitarian situation in Ethiopia is dire. The war in Tigray has displaced over two million people, with many fleeing to neighboring countries like Sudan. The conflict has caused severe food shortages, with millions of people facing famine conditions. In addition to the war, the country is grappling with widespread poverty, underdevelopment, and a fragile healthcare system that is ill-equipped to handle the crisis. The political and humanitarian crises have placed enormous strain on the Ethiopian government, which is struggling to balance the demands of war and peace.</p>

<p>Abiy’s once-glowing international reputation has taken a serious hit. While he was once lauded as a champion of peace, his leadership is now under intense scrutiny. World leaders who once praised his reforms and his peace efforts are now calling for accountability, and there are growing calls for sanctions against his government in response to human rights violations. His Nobel Peace Prize is now viewed by many as premature, given the ongoing violence and the erosion of democratic principles in Ethiopia.</p>

<p>The question now is what the future holds for Ethiopia. Abiy’s government faces mounting pressure both domestically and internationally. The country remains deeply divided, with ethnic tensions simmering in many regions. The war in Tigray has created a profound sense of mistrust and fear, and the humanitarian crisis continues to worsen. It is unclear whether Abiy will be able to restore peace and unity or if Ethiopia will descend further into civil conflict. The international community has an important role to play in pushing for a peaceful resolution, but the path to reconciliation appears to be fraught with difficulty.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Abiy Ahmed's transformation from a celebrated reformer to a controversial figure highlights the complexities of leadership in a deeply divided nation. His initial promises of peace, reform, and unity have been overshadowed by the ongoing conflict, repression, and humanitarian crisis. The suffering of the Ethiopian people, particularly in the Amhara and Tigray regions, underscores the dire need for a new direction, one that puts the welfare of Ethiopia’s citizens above political survival and ethnic power struggles. Whether Ethiopia can find a way forward remains uncertain, but the current trajectory suggests that the road ahead will be long and difficult.</p>

        <i>What a second Trump Term Would look like. - </i>
<p><b>On November 6th,</b> the world woke up to the news that 74 million American voters had reelected Donald J. Trump as their next President. For the first time in 20 years, Trump won both the Popular Vote and the Electoral College vote, defeating incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<h2>Key Issues Under Trump's Second Term</h2>
<p>As President, Trump has outlined several key domestic and foreign policy priorities for his second term in office:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Domestic Plans:</b> Trump has promised to focus on cutting taxes, reducing regulations, and bolstering the economy through pro-business policies. His administration aims to strengthen manufacturing, increase energy independence, and improve the healthcare system by reducing government involvement and expanding private sector competition.</li>
    <li><b>Immigration:</b> A cornerstone of Trump's 2016 and 2020 campaigns, his second term is expected to see a continuation of hardline immigration policies. Trump has indicated plans to further tighten border security, expand the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and prioritize deportation of undocumented immigrants involved in criminal activities.</li>
    <li><b>NATO:</b> Trump has been a vocal critic of NATO during his first term, questioning the alliance’s value to the U.S. and calling for other member nations to increase their defense spending. In a second term, Trump is expected to push for greater burden-sharing among NATO members while maintaining the alliance's relevance in a changing geopolitical landscape.</li>
    <li><b>Russo-Ukrainian War:</b> Trump's approach to the ongoing war in Ukraine is likely to prioritize negotiation over continued U.S. military involvement. While Trump has criticized U.S. financial and military aid to Ukraine, his stance has evolved, with some reports suggesting that he may seek a ceasefire and peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, should he return to office.</li>
    <li><b>Gaza and Israel War:</b> Trump's foreign policy in the Middle East is expected to remain pro-Israel, reinforcing his previous stance during his first term. He has voiced strong support for Israeli security measures and criticized international efforts to challenge Israel's position on Palestinian territories. His administration may also seek a more aggressive stance against Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Road to a Stronger America: Trump's First Term and What’s Next</h2>

<img src="/images/trumprally.jpg" alt="Donald Trump at rally" style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius: 8px;">

<p>Donald Trump's first term was marked by bold policies that prioritized American interests above all else. From tax cuts that spurred economic growth to deregulation that fueled job creation, Trump’s presidency proved that a pro-business, America-first approach could deliver tangible results. Unemployment reached historic lows, wages rose, and the stock market surged—defining moments of his tenure that continue to shape the nation’s economic landscape.</p>

<p>In foreign policy, Trump’s "America First" doctrine brought a shift toward realism, questioning longstanding alliances and trade deals that he believed were unfair to the U.S. He renegotiated NAFTA, withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement, and challenged China on trade practices. His tough stance on international relations made clear that the U.S. would no longer be taken advantage of, earning him both admiration and criticism around the world. Yet, for many Americans, Trump's leadership restored a sense of national pride and strength on the global stage.</p>

<p>Looking ahead to his second term, Trump’s vision for America is clear: a nation where jobs are plentiful, the border is secure, and American power is respected. The speculation around what a second Trump administration could mean is largely shaped by the success of his first-term policies, but with a renewed focus on issues like energy independence, manufacturing revival, and military strength. His commitment to putting America first will likely guide his decisions, both domestically and internationally, ensuring that his policies are centered around the American people.</p>

<p>With the support of millions of voters and a record of success behind him, Trump’s re-election signifies a return to conservative values, economic prosperity, and a strong, independent America. As he moves forward, his leadership will continue to champion the ideals that made the U.S. great, ensuring a brighter future for generations to come.</p>

      <i>*Stolen Ethiopia Crown in British Measum</i>
    <p>The struggle for justice continues as the <strong>Royal Ethiopian Trust</strong>, an organization dedicated to advancing the legacy of His Imperial Highness Prince Ermias Sahle-Selassie, takes a stand to recover Ethiopia’s stolen artifacts. These treasures, which symbolize Ethiopia’s rich imperial history, were unlawfully taken during the colonial era, and their return is now a focal point for the Ethiopian diaspora and nationalists alike.</p>
    
    <p>The <strong>Royal Ethiopian Trust</strong> is driven by a mission not only to recover and protect Ethiopia’s stolen heritage but also to ensure the future prosperity and unity of the nation. By focusing on four critical pillars—empowering Ethiopia’s youth, fostering entrepreneurship, preserving its imperial heritage, and supporting the Ethiopian Crown—the organization is taking comprehensive action to restore Ethiopia’s rightful place in the world.</p>

    <h2>Empowering Ethiopia’s Future</h2>
    <p>At the heart of the Trust's mission is the empowerment of Ethiopia's next generation. Through educational initiatives, mentorship, and scholarships, the Trust seeks to nurture young Ethiopians who can lead the nation into a brighter future. It is believed that the restoration of cultural and historical treasures will foster a deeper connection to the nation’s legacy, inspiring a renewed sense of pride and unity.</p>

    <h2>Fostering Ethiopian Entrepreneurship</h2>
    <p>In addition to restoring its heritage, the Trust is investing in Ethiopia's economic future. Through fostering entrepreneurship, particularly in the cultural sector, the organization hopes to create jobs, drive innovation, and stimulate sustainable economic growth. By supporting Ethiopian entrepreneurs, the Trust aims to unlock the untapped potential within the country.</p>

    <h2>Preserving Ethiopia’s Imperial Heritage</h2>
    <p>Perhaps the most significant part of the Trust’s mission is to preserve the artifacts and treasures that tell the story of Ethiopia’s imperial past. Artifacts, crowns, and royal regalia that were taken by foreign powers in the past century must be returned, not just for historical reasons, but to restore a vital link to the culture and identity of the Ethiopian people. The Trust is spearheading efforts to establish a world-class Ethiopian imperial museum that will not only house these priceless artifacts but serve as a center for education and cultural pride.</p>

    <h2>Supporting the Ethiopian Crown</h2>
    <p>The Ethiopian monarchy is an enduring symbol of national unity and pride. Despite being abolished in 1974, the Crown continues to hold deep significance for the Ethiopian people. The Royal Ethiopian Trust works to support the Ethiopian Crown, ensuring that the legacy of the monarchy remains a positive force for social cohesion and cultural identity. As part of their broader efforts, the Trust is working to strengthen the role of the Crown in Ethiopia's modern era, reaffirming its influence as a unifying symbol of the nation.</p>

    <p>Through these pillars, the <strong>Royal Ethiopian Trust</strong> is not just fighting to bring back stolen artifacts—it is working tirelessly to ensure that Ethiopia’s cultural, historical, and economic future is secure. The restoration of Ethiopia’s imperial treasures is a cause that transcends borders and generations, uniting Ethiopians around the world in a shared vision for justice and cultural preservation.</p>

      <p>Ethiopia's History is complicated yet beautiful. Ruled based on intergrity, honor, and dignity. All of that is lost now.</p>
<p>The Ethiopian monarchy is one of the oldest continuous monarchies in the world, with a rich history that stretches over three millennia. From its legendary origins with the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon, the monarchy played a central role in shaping Ethiopian identity, politics, and religion. This history, however, has not been without its challenges, and the monarchy saw both triumph and tragedy before its eventual overthrow in the 20th century.</p>

<h2>Monarchy Success in Ethiopia</h2>

<p>For much of Ethiopia’s history, the monarchy was seen as a symbol of national unity, political stability, and pride. The rise of the Solomonic dynasty, which began in the 13th century, marked the golden era of the monarchy. Under Emperor Menelik II, Ethiopia achieved remarkable success, most notably with the defeat of Italy in the Battle of Adwa in 1896. This victory ensured Ethiopia’s independence, making it one of the few African nations to resist European colonization. Menelik’s diplomatic acumen and military strength helped solidify Ethiopia's position as a sovereign state in a rapidly changing world. The monarchy’s power also laid the foundation for a unified Ethiopian identity, connecting the diverse ethnic and religious groups under a single imperial banner.</p>

<h2>It's EVEN GREATER Success</h2>

<p>Under the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie I, the Ethiopian monarchy reached even greater heights. Haile Selassie, one of Africa’s most influential figures, modernized Ethiopia through reforms in education, infrastructure, and governance. His leadership played a pivotal role in securing Ethiopia’s place on the world stage, particularly when he became the first African leader to address the League of Nations in 1936, appealing against Italy’s invasion. He sought to modernize the country, building roads, schools, and a modern military. His vision extended beyond Ethiopia, with Selassie becoming a founding member of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), promoting African unity and independence. He also embraced Western-style governance reforms, all of which made him an international symbol of African dignity and resistance against colonialism.</p>

<h2>It's Fall by the Evil Derg</h2>

<p>The fall of the Ethiopian monarchy came in 1974, when a Marxist military junta known as the Derg, led by Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam, overthrew Haile Selassie’s government. The coup was driven by widespread dissatisfaction with the monarchy’s perceived inability to address poverty, corruption, and political repression. The Derg promised to address these issues through a radical socialist agenda. However, their reign led to a period of extreme violence and repression. Haile Selassie, the revered monarch, was imprisoned and later died under mysterious circumstances in 1975, while the Derg executed thousands of perceived political enemies during a campaign of terror known as the "Red Terror." The monarchy’s fall marked the end of an era that had spanned over three thousand years, and Ethiopia plunged into a period of political instability and bloodshed.</p>

<h2>Genocides and Massacres by the Derg Against Royals and Civilians</h2>

<p>The Derg’s rule was marked by brutality against both the Ethiopian people and the former royal family. During the “Red Terror,” the Derg targeted anyone they considered a threat to their authority, including intellectuals, former military officers, and civilians. The royal family was not spared; many members of the imperial family were executed or disappeared. The Derg also initiated a series of massacres, including the killing of thousands of ethnic civilians and political opponents. The genocidal policies of the Derg decimated communities and led to widespread suffering across the country. The violence, coupled with economic mismanagement, further isolated Ethiopia from the international community and left a deep scar on the national psyche.</p>

<h2>The Great Haile Selassie</h2>

<p>Emperor Haile Selassie remains one of the most iconic figures in Ethiopian and African history. Revered as the “Lion of Judah” and the “Defender of the Faith,” Selassie was a symbol of Ethiopian pride and resistance, not only within Ethiopia but across the African continent. He was a key figure in the establishment of the Organization of African Unity and worked to secure Ethiopia’s independence on the international stage. His speeches, such as the famous 1936 address to the League of Nations, continue to resonate as symbols of defiance against imperialism. In the Rastafarian movement, he is considered a messianic figure, symbolizing the hope for redemption. Despite his eventual overthrow, his legacy remains a beacon of pride for Ethiopians and a symbol of Africa’s struggle for independence and unity.</p>

<h2>Restoration of the Monarchy</h2>

<p>Though the Ethiopian monarchy was abolished with the Derg’s rise to power, the idea of restoring the monarchy continues to be a topic of debate in Ethiopia. Various royalists and former supporters of the imperial family have expressed interest in restoring the monarchy in some form, particularly as Ethiopia continues to struggle with political instability and ethnic conflict. The question of monarchy restoration is tied to a broader discussion of Ethiopia’s future governance, as the country grapples with federalism, ethnic-based political divisions, and the desire for national unity. While the possibility of a true restoration remains uncertain, the legacy of the Ethiopian monarchy, with its long history of tradition, identity, and leadership, continues to be an important part of the nation's cultural fabric.</p>

      <h2>"THE VIEW" Praises Liz Cheney's "Moral Core"</h2>

   <p>Liz Cheney, daughter of a literal war criminal, Dick Cheney, who played a pivotal role in the genocidal Iraq War, is being hailed as a "good person" by mainstream media figures like those on *The View*. This praise for Liz Cheney, despite her unwavering support for her father's catastrophic decisions—decisions that led to the deaths of over a million people—reveals a staggering level of hypocrisy and a complete failure to hold powerful figures accountable for their war crimes.</p>

<h2>The Cheney Legacy of War Crimes</h2>

<p>Dick Cheney, former Vice President of the United States, was one of the chief architects of the Iraq War. This war, based on false intelligence and fabricated claims of weapons of mass destruction, resulted in one of the greatest humanitarian disasters of the 21st century. Tens of thousands of soldiers, countless innocent civilians, and millions of displaced people—this was the legacy of Cheney's decisions. Despite these crimes, Cheney has never been held accountable, and yet, his daughter, Liz Cheney, continues to profit politically from her family's role in this bloodshed. How is it possible that she is called a "good person" when her actions directly support the same policies that led to global devastation?</p>

<h2>The Double Standards of Global Justice</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, Donald Trump, who came into office with a platform that was criticized for its unpredictability and controversial rhetoric, faces relentless scrutiny for matters that, while politically divisive, pale in comparison to the mass atrocities committed during the Iraq War. It is a travesty that figures like Cheney, who actively supported and orchestrated these atrocities, remain untouchable, while Trump—often criticized for his inflammatory rhetoric and political missteps—is vilified to the highest degree. This selective outrage undermines the very concept of justice and exposes the hypocrisy of the political establishment.</p>

<h2>The Global Silence on War Crimes</h2>

<p>The world watched in silence as Cheney, along with figures like George W. Bush and Donald Rumsfeld, drove the United States into a war of aggression that violated international law and led to genocide-level violence. Despite overwhelming evidence that the invasion was based on lies and resulted in war crimes, these individuals have faced little to no legal consequences. The United Nations and international courts have long maintained that such actions qualify as war crimes, yet Cheney and his ilk walk free, while the world continues to ignore the blood on their hands.</p>

<h2>The True Cost of the Iraq War</h2>

<p>The war in Iraq, orchestrated by Cheney and others, not only caused untold suffering but destabilized an entire region. The rise of ISIS, the collapse of Iraq as a unified nation, and the spread of sectarian violence were direct results of this reckless invasion. The so-called "war on terror" has left millions dead or displaced, with entire generations of Iraqis growing up in a post-apocalyptic environment. And yet, Cheney—along with other war criminals—continues to live a life free of consequences. Meanwhile, Trump, often criticized for his policies and handling of international relations, is painted as the ultimate villain, despite his administration having no direct involvement in this kind of mass destruction.</p>

<h2>Why the Global Justice System Fails</h2>

<p>International justice is supposed to be about holding the powerful accountable. But the case of Dick Cheney, Liz Cheney, and the Iraq War highlights a dark truth: when the powerful commit war crimes, they are rarely held accountable. Instead, they are celebrated, protected, and even revered. This broken system allows figures like Cheney, who enabled one of the most disastrous conflicts in modern history, to escape justice. And at the same time, figures like Donald Trump—who, despite his many faults, did not launch illegal wars or cause millions of deaths—are relentlessly persecuted, often based on political motives rather than genuine justice.</p>

<h2>The Hypocrisy of the "Good Person" Narrative</h2>

<p>It is an affront to true morality that Liz Cheney is praised as a "good person" while continuing to support the policies that enabled one of the most violent wars in modern history. Her praise for her father’s actions, which led to the deaths of millions, should not be ignored or overlooked. Instead, the world should look at Cheney's role in the Iraq War, and ask: How is it possible that a person who supports such devastation is considered morally superior to someone like Donald Trump, who is still facing political trials and public condemnation, despite not being responsible for these horrors? The standards are not only inconsistent—they are unjust.</p>

<h2>The Global Failure of Accountability</h2>

<p>Ultimately, the global justice system fails because it refuses to apply the same standards to all. When war criminals like Dick Cheney walk free, and figures like Donald Trump are relentlessly scrutinized for far lesser offenses, it exposes the hypocrisy and the lack of true justice in international politics.</p>
